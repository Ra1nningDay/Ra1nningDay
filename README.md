<p align="left">I started my adventure with PHP, Laravel, and MySQL, building web apps and taming database. Those were fun days! But I’m all about growth, so I dove into the TypeScript universe, rocking Next.js for slick, scalable frontends and NestJS for bulletproof backends. This stack? It’s my happy place—clean, structured, and endlessly fun to play with. And yeah, I swapped VS Code (still cool, no hate!) for Neovim. Why? Because I’m a sucker for a challenge, and nailing those keybindings feels like unlocking a superpower. :wq is basically my life motto now.</p>
