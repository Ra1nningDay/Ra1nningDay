<p align="left">I'm just a regular guy who started coding a few years ago after dipping my toes in IT support. I’m passionate about backend development and data management, and I’ve been building projects with tools like PHP, Laravel, and MySQL. I usually code in VS Code, but recently I’ve been challenging myself with NeoVim—because why not? Right now, I’m focused on sharpening my backend skills, and maybe in a couple of years, I’ll dive into AI stuff.</p>
